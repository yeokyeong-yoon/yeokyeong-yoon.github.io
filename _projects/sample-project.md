## Feature Flag Project

This project provides a robust implementation of feature flags (also known as feature toggles) that allows developers to modify system behavior without changing code.

### Key Features

- **Centralized Toggle Management**: Manage all feature toggles from a single dashboard
- **Granular User Targeting**: Enable features for specific users, groups, or percentages
- **A/B Testing Support**: Run multiple variants of a feature and collect usage metrics
- **API-First Design**: RESTful API for integration with any platform
- **Audit Logging**: Track all changes to toggle configurations

### Technical Implementation

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Admin Dashboard**: A React application for managing toggles
2. **Feature Flag Service**: Spring Boot backend for storing and serving toggle configurations
3. **Client SDK**: Libraries for various platforms to check toggle states

### Outcomes

This project has enabled:

- Deploying code to production that is not yet ready for all users
- Testing features with specific user groups before wider rollout
- Running A/B tests to determine the best performing variant of a feature
- Quickly turning off problematic features without a new deployment
